Hold on, hear me out
Empty rooms can be so loud
I just wanna let you know I'm proud
I just wanna let you know I'm proud
Close your eyes, tune them out
You're right here, with me now
I just wanna let you know I'm proud
I just wanna let you know I'm proud
I just wanna let you know I'm proud
I just wanna let you know I'm proud
I just wanna let you know I'm proud
I just wanna let you know I'm proud
I just wanna let you know I'm proud
Hold on, hear me out
Empty rooms can be so loud
I just wanna let you know I'm proud
I just wanna let you know I'm proud
Close your eyes, tune them out
You're right here, with me now
I just wanna let you know I'm proud
I just wanna let you know I'm proud
I just wanna let you know I'm proud
I just wanna let you know I'm proud
I just wanna let you know I'm proud
Hold on, hear me out
Empty rooms can be so loud
I just wanna let you know I'm proud
I just wanna let you know I'm proud
Close your eyes, tune them out
You're right here, with me now
I just wanna let you know I'm proud
I just wanna let you know I'm proud
