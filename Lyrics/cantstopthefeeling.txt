Ah, yeah, ah, yeah
I got this feelin' inside my bones
It goes electric, wavy when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flyin' up, no ceilin', when we in our zone
I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, movin' so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Nothin' I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feel a good, good creepin' up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leavin' soon, so keep dancin'
I can't stop the feelin'
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feelin'
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushin' on (rushin' on)
I don't need no reason, don't need control (need control)
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone
'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop (stop, stop, stop)
Under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feel a good, good, creepin' up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leavin' soon, so keep dancin'
I can't stop the feelin'
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feelin'
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feelin'
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feelin' (yeah)
So keep dancin', come on
Oh, yeah, yeah
I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the feelin'
Nothin' I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance (I can't stop the feelin')
Feel the good, good, creepin' up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on (I can't stop the feelin')
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance (dance, dance, dance) (I can't stop the feelin')
And ain't nobody leavin' soon, so keep dancin'
Everybody sing (I can't stop the feelin')
Got this feeling in my body (I can't stop the feelin')
Got this feeling in my body (I can't stop the feelin')
Wanna see you move your body (I can't stop the feelin')
Got this feelin' in my body
Break it down
Got this feelin' in my body (ah)
Can't stop the feelin'
Got this feelin' in my body, come on (ooh)
